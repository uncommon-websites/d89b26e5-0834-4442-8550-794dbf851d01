    "description": "The image depicts a large yellow bulldozer operating in a rocky, rough terrain during heavy rain. The environment is dark and gloomy with stormy clouds dominating the sky. The rain is clearly visible, creating streaks across the image and splashing on the wet, uneven ground. The bulldozer is moving soil and rocks, evident by the pile in front of its blade. The backdrop shows rugged, rocky hills or mounds, blending into the overcast sky. The scene evokes a sense of intense weather conditions and tough, industrial work amidst the harsh terrain."
